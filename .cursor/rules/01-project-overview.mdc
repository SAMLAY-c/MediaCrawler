# MediaCrawler Project Overview

MediaCrawler is a crawler toolkit for various social media platforms in China, including:
- Xiaohongshu (小红书)
- Douyin (抖音)
- Kuaishou (快手)
- Bilibili (B站)
- Weibo (微博)
- Tieba (贴吧)

The project uses [Playwright](mdc:https:/playwright.dev) to maintain browser context after login, which helps avoid complex JS reverse engineering for encrypted parameters.

## Key Features

- Specific post details retrieval
- Comment extraction (including sub-comments)
- Creator profile data scraping
- Login state caching
- IP proxy pool support
- Comment word cloud generation
